# Basic-Exfiltration-Over-Web-Service
This is just a very basic example of how someone could move data over the network using a readily available service called HFS which creates 
a http server in a few click of a button. This example shown isnt the best way of securely sharing a file for extended period of times but 
with the rising amount of sharing files temporarily for download online, I believed that this is a great way of showing the movement of data/files over
available web services. as transfer of data is shown across the network  from Wireshark as it is an amazing and fun way of watching the movement of
certain data and playing around on how data would appear in the analysis tool.
